Business Email Compromise (BEC)
BEC targets email systems, encompassing CEO fraud, account compromise, false invoice scheme, attorney impersonation, and data theft.
While email scanning and machine learning have improved, attackers evolve, requiring continuous enhancement of detection systems.
This project aims to build a prototype to counter BEC threats.
